## üìå Description

Payload injection is a technique used to execute arbitrary code in the context of another process. This is a core part of offensive operations, post-exploitation, and malware behavior. The examples in this repository demonstrate how attackers inject DLLs or obfuscated shellcode into remote processes using Windows API functions.

*The repo currently includes*:

- **Remote Dll Injection**
- **Remote Shellcode Injection**

## üß∞ Features

- Lightweight and simple C implementations.
- Can be easily integrated into other malware or red team projects.
- Helps blue teams understand how process injection is done in the wild.
