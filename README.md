##  Description

Payload injection is a technique used to execute arbitrary code in the context of another process. This is a core part of offensive operations, post-exploitation, and malware behavior. The examples in this repository demonstrate how attackers inject DLLs or obfuscated shellcode into remote processes using Windows API functions.

*The repo currently includes*:

- **Remote Dll Injection**
- **Remote Shellcode Injection**

## Features

- Lightweight and simple C implementations.
- Can be easily integrated into other malware or red team projects.
- Helps blue teams understand how process injection is done in the wild.

 
## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Zanebilal/ProcessInjectionTechniques
```
2.open the desired injection tequnique in microsoft vscode
3. build the file in the solution mode
